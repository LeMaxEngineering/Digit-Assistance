# Project Chat Log

This file is used to record all important chats, decisions, and context for the Digital Assistance App project. Use this log to keep track of progress, requirements, and any agreements or clarifications made during development.

---

## Conversation Log (to this point)

### Project Progress & Decisions
- The project follows a step-by-step plan outlined in `development_plan.md`.
- Steps completed so far include project setup, Supabase configuration, authentication context, splash screen, authentication screens, dashboard, document creation, scanning, processing, editing/export, email sending/storage, and document history/detail screens.
- The UI/UX is being modernized to match bold, branded styles (inspired by Revolut/GoPay examples).
- The splash screen was redesigned to use a construction workers image as background, then updated to use a local image `splash01.png`.
- The logo is kept as is, and the splash screen now features a bold headline and two prominent buttons (Log in, Sign up).

### Technical Issues & Fixes
- Encountered missing dependency errors for `jspdf-autotable` during bundling. Solution: install the package with `npm install jspdf-autotable`.
- Confirmed the database structure is outlined in the plan (Users, Documents, Companies tables), but field-level details are not specified in the codebase.

### Project Organization
- Created this `project_chat_log.md` file to persistently log all important chats, decisions, and project context, as previous chat history was lost.

### Latest Supabase Database Structure (Updated June 2024)

**Current Schema (as per DB diagram):**

```sql
-- 1. Companies Table
CREATE TABLE companies (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    name text NOT NULL,
    created_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT timezone('utc', now()),
    updated_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT timezone('utc', now())
);

-- 2. User Profiles (Extends Supabase Auth)
CREATE TABLE profiles (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id), -- Same as auth.users.id
    full_name text,
    company_id uuid REFERENCES companies(id),
    created_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT timezone('utc', now()),
    updated_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT timezone('utc', now())
);

-- 3. Documents Table
CREATE TABLE documents (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id uuid REFERENCES auth.users(id) NOT NULL, -- FK to auth.users, not profiles
    company_id uuid REFERENCES companies(id),
    status text,
    qrcode text,
    created_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT timezone('utc', now()),
    updated_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT timezone('utc', now()),
    document_date date
);

-- 4. Document Details Table
CREATE TABLE documents_details (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    document_id uuid REFERENCES documents(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    worker_name text,
    time_start time,
    time_end time,
    observation text
);
```

**Key Points:**
- `documents.user_id` references `auth.users(id)` (the Supabase Auth user UUID).
- `profiles.id` is also the Auth user UUID, but is only for user metadata (name, company, etc.).
- There is **no foreign key** from `documents.user_id` to `profiles.id`.
- All user authentication and existence checks should use `auth.users` as the source of truth.
- The `profiles` table is for additional user info and can be joined on `id` if needed.
- This structure avoids foreign key constraint issues and follows Supabase best practices.

### npm audit Results (Dependency Vulnerabilities)

- **Moderate vulnerabilities in `undici` (used by Firebase and related packages):**
  - These are inherited from Firebase dependencies.
  - Ran `npm audit fix`, but some issues remain because fixes are not yet available in the current versions.
  - **Action:** Keep Firebase and related packages up to date. Monitor for updates and upgrade when possible.

- **High severity vulnerability in `xlsx`:**
  - Known vulnerability with no fix currently available.
  - **Action:** Use with caution, limit use to trusted data, and monitor for updates or consider alternatives if possible.

- **Funding warnings:**
  - Informational only; no action required unless you wish to support open-source maintainers.

#### Summary Table

| Vulnerability | Package      | Fix Available? | Action                        |
|---------------|--------------|----------------|-------------------------------|
| Moderate      | undici       | Partial        | Wait for Firebase update      |
| High          | xlsx         | No             | Use with caution, monitor     |

**General advice:**

### Latest Refactor: Centralized Styles & Unified Auth Screens (June 2024)

#### Centralized Global Styles
- Created `app/styles/globalStyles.js` to hold all shared style definitions (container, button, logo, title, etc.).
- Updated Login and Register screens to import and use these shared styles, improving maintainability and scalability.

#### Unified Login & Register UI
- Refactored both Login (`app/auth/login.jsx`) and Register (`app/auth/register.jsx`) screens to use the same layout, components, and style structure.
- Both screens now use the same custom `Input` component, logo placement, button styles, and error handling.
- Navigation and validation logic is consistent across both screens.

#### Logo Size Update
- Doubled the logo size on both Login and Register screens for improved branding and visual impact.

#### Benefits
- Easier to maintain and update the app's look and feel from a single location.
- Consistent user experience across authentication screens.
- Improved scalability for future features and screens.

#### Next Steps
- Continue migrating other screens to use centralized styles.
- Consider extracting more shared UI components as the app grows.
- Keep `project_chat_log.md` updated with all major refactors and decisions.

---

### UI/UX Refactor: Unified Global Styles Across All Screens (June 2024)

- All main screens (Login, Register, Dashboard, New Document, Document History) now use:
  - The same background image (`splash01.png`) via globalStyles.backgroundImage
  - The same container and layout via globalStyles.container
  - A semi-transparent white form box (globalStyles.formBox) for main content
  - Shared logo, button, and error styles from globalStyles.js
- Removed page-specific duplicate styles in favor of global styles
- Ensured all forms, cards, and main content are visually consistent and modern
- Next: Continue updating remaining screens (scanner, edit, process, historyDetail, etc.) for full app-wide consistency

---

### Expo Go Error: Node.js Standard Library Module Not Supported (June 2024)

- **Issue:**
  - Error: The package at "node_modules\ws\lib\websocket-server.js" attempted to import the Node standard library module "events". It failed because the native React runtime does not include the Node standard library.
  - This error appears when running the app in Expo Go.
- **Cause:**
  - A dependency (direct or indirect) is trying to use Node.js-only modules (`ws`, `events`, etc.), which are not available in Expo Go or React Native.
  - This typically happens if a server-side or Node.js-specific package is included in the project dependencies.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Review `package.json` for any Node.js-only packages (e.g., `ws`, `socket.io`, `express`, etc.) and remove or replace them with React Native/Expo compatible alternatives.
  - Use the built-in `WebSocket` API for real-time features in React Native/Expo.
  - Keep server-side code separate from the Expo project.
  - Continue troubleshooting by checking all dependencies and imports for Node.js-only usage.

---

### Multi-Step Document Creation & Context (June 2024)

- Implemented a React Context (`DocumentContext`) to store new document form data in memory across navigation steps.
- When a user fills out the form in `/document/new` and clicks "Next":
  - The form data (code, company_id, user_id, document_date, status) is saved in context, not yet sent to the database.
  - The user is navigated to the `/scanner` page.
- On the `/scanner` page, the form data is displayed at the top for review, confirming the information before any database save or further processing.
- This approach enables a true multi-step form flow, improves user experience, and prevents premature database writes.
- Next: Integrate the actual document creation and detail saving after scanning is complete.

---

### Multi-Step Document Processing & Export Flow (June 2024)

- Defined a multi-step flow for document creation and processing:
  1. User fills out the document form (head info) in `/document/new`.
  2. User scans or selects images in `/scanner`.
  3. Images are processed with OCR/AI to extract body information (name, entry time, exit time).
  4. If no valid data is extracted, the app displays: "The AI ​​could not obtain any information from the images" and provides links to return to the scanner or dashboard.
  5. If valid data is extracted, the app displays:
     - Head information
     - A select for export format (PDF, text, CSV, Excel)
     - A table with the extracted body info
     - A "Generate Document" button
  6. On "Generate Document":
     - Head info is saved to the `documents` table
     - The returned document ID is used to save each row of body info to the `documents_details` table
     - The requested document is generated (PDF, etc.)
     - The user is prompted for an email to send the document
- Updated the database table name for body information to `documents_details` (plural, as per latest schema)
- Next: Implement the new `/document/process` page and connect all steps in the flow

### Revert: Removal of Google Vision/OCR Integration (June 2024)

- **Issue:** After integrating Google Cloud Vision and related OCR/AI features, persistent errors and instability were encountered (Metro bundler ENOENT errors, missing/broken dependencies, and workflow issues).
- **Decision:** Revert all changes related to Google Vision/OCR and restore the last known working state (manual document processing and export flow).
- **Files affected:**
  - `app/document/process.jsx` reverted to load document and images from Supabase, allow manual data entry/editing, and export/email as before.
  - `app/utils/visionApi.js` and related OCR code are no longer used.
  - `app/utils/documentStorage.js` and new storage utilities are no longer used.
  - All references to `processDocumentImages`, Google Vision, and OCR have been removed from the workflow.
- **Current state:**
  - The app now uses manual data entry for document processing and export.
  - Users scan/select images, which are uploaded to Supabase Storage.
  - The process page loads images and allows manual entry/editing of employee data.
  - Export (PDF, CSV, XLSX) and email sending work as before, without OCR/AI.
  - The app is stable and the scan-to-process-to-export flow is functional.
- **Next steps:**
  - Continue with the development plan using the manual workflow.
  - Consider reintroducing OCR/AI in the future with a more robust approach if needed.

### Calendar/Date Picker Restored in New Document Form (June 2024)

- **Issue:** The calendar/date picker was not showing in the "New Document" form after recent changes and refactors.
- **Fix:** Updated the form to use a visible `<input type="date">` for web and `@react-native-community/datetimepicker` for native platforms.
- **Result:**
  - Users can now select a date easily on all platforms.
  - The selected date is stored in `YYYY-MM-DD` format and displayed as `MM/DD/YYYY`.
  - The multi-step document creation flow (form → scan → process → export) is fully functional again.
  - The app is stable and ready for the next development steps.

---

### Date Input Restrictions & Locale Consistency (June 2024)

- **Change:** The date input in the New Document form is now restricted to today or earlier (future dates are not allowed) on all platforms.
- **Implementation:**
  - On web, the `<input type="date">` uses the `max` attribute set to today.
  - On native, the `DateTimePicker` uses `maximumDate={new Date()}`.
- **Date Format:**
  - All user-facing date fields now display dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.
  - Dates are stored internally as YYYY-MM-DD for consistency.
- **Locale:**
  - The calendar on iOS is now forced to English (`locale="en-US"`).
  - On Android and web, the picker follows the device/browser language.
- **Result:**
  - The multi-step document creation and scanning flow is robust, user-friendly, and locale-consistent for date handling.
  - Users cannot select a future date, ensuring accurate assistance control records.

---

### OCR Integration Reintroduced: Google Vision API in 'Process Images' Workflow (June 2024)

- **Decision:** Resume integrating OCR (Google Vision API) into the workflow, specifically triggered by the 'Process Images' button in `scanner.jsx`.
- **Workflow:**
  1. When the user clicks 'Process Images', all selected images are sent to the Google Vision API for OCR processing.
  2. The OCR results are parsed for compatible data (Employee Name, Start Time, End Time).
  3. If no valid data is found, the user is notified and the workflow stops.
  4. If valid data is found, it is stored in context and the app navigates to the process/export page.
  5. On the process/export page, the user can review, edit, export, and email the extracted data, or save it locally.
- **Context:**
  - This is a reintroduction of OCR after a previous rollback due to technical issues.
  - The implementation will proceed step by step, starting with the OCR integration in the scanner step.

---

### Document Processing & OCR Integration (June 2024)

#### Document Parser Implementation
- Created `documentParser.js` utility to handle OCR text processing:
  - Extracts document date from "SIGN IN SHEET" format
  - Parses worker records with ID, name, time in, and time out
  - Handles various time formats (6:45, 645, 640)
  - Validates parsed data for completeness
  - Formats data for display with status indicators

#### Process Screen Updates
- Enhanced `process.jsx` to display structured document data:
  - Shows document date and worker statistics
  - Displays validation warnings for missing data
  - Presents worker records in a table with:
    - ID
    - Name
    - Time In
    - Time Out
    - Status (Complete, Missing Time In, Missing Time Out, Missing Time Data)
  - Color-coded status indicators for better visibility
  - Maintains export and email functionality

#### Data Structure
- Document data is now organized as:
  ```javascript
  {
    date: "05/07/2025",
    workers: [
      {
        id: 28,
        name: "HARRISON SAMAYOA CALVILLO",
        timeIn: "6:45",
        timeOut: null,
        status: "Missing Time Out"
      },
      // ... more workers
    ]
  }
  ```

#### Next Steps
1. Add inline editing for worker records
2. Implement filtering and sorting options
3. Enhance time format validation
4. Add batch operations for missing data
5. Improve error handling for OCR failures

---

### UI/UX and Parser Improvements for Document Process Screen (June 2024)

- Unified the "Document Information" and export/email section into a single card for a seamless, modern look.
- Ensured all form elements (document info, export format selector, save locally checkbox, email input) use global styles and are visually consistent.
- Improved spacing and alignment between logo, document info, and employee records for a more compact and professional layout.
- Enhanced the employee records table: all headers and values are now black for readability, with section titles in the app's primary color.
- The parser now:
  - Skips any line after the first occurrence of 'Page X of Y' (e.g., 'Page 2 of 14'), ensuring only valid worker data is processed.
  - Accepts only valid time values (≤ 23:59) for time in/out fields; invalid times are ignored.
  - Handles multi-page OCR by allowing concatenation and robust parsing of multiple sheets.
- All changes maintain a consistent, branded, and user-friendly experience across the process flow.

---

### Multi-Page OCR Parsing & Robust Document Processing (June 2024)

#### Problem
- The app previously only processed employee data from the first scanned page, ignoring additional pages in multi-sheet documents.
- The parser logic stopped at the first "Page X of Y" footer, discarding all subsequent content.

#### Solution
- **Scanner Step:**  
  - All OCR text from every scanned image is now concatenated and passed to the process step.
  - The scanner no longer attempts to parse employee data itself; parsing is centralized in the process step.
- **Parser Update:**  
  - The parser now removes all "Page X of Y" lines from the OCR text, but does not stop at the first occurrence.
  - All lines from all pages are processed, so every employee record from every scanned sheet is included.
- **Result:**  
  - Multi-page scanned documents are now fully supported.
  - Employee records from all pages are parsed, displayed, and available for editing/export.

#### UI/UX
- The "Process Images" and "Next" buttons now consistently use the global primary button style with white, bold text for clarity and branding.

#### Next Steps
- Continue to refine multi-page parsing for edge cases (e.g., page headers, repeated columns).
- Consider adding visual page breaks or indicators in the UI for multi-sheet documents.
- Monitor for any further OCR or parsing edge cases as more real-world documents are tested.

---

### Updated Database Structure (June 2024)

**Note:** The following structure reflects the actual schema in use, now including the new places table and the place_id column in documents as of June 2024.

#### companies
- id (uuid, PK)
- name (text)
- created_at (timestamp)
- updated_at (timestamp)

#### profiles
- id (uuid, PK)
- full_name (text)
- company_id (uuid)
- created_at (timestamp)
- updated_at (timestamp)

#### places
- id (uuid, PK)
- company_id (uuid, FK to companies)
- name (text)
- created_at (timestamp)
- updated_at (timestamp)

#### documents
- id (uuid, PK)
- user_id (uuid)
- company_id (uuid)
- place_id (uuid, FK to places)
- status (text)
- qrcode (text)
- created_at (timestamp)
- updated_at (timestamp)
- document_date (date)

#### documents_details
- id (uuid, PK)
- document_id (uuid)
- worker_name (text)
- time_start (time)
- time_end (time)
- observation (text)

**Constraints:**
- Unique constraint on (company_id, document_date, place_id) in documents to prevent duplicate documents for the same company, date, and place.

**Business Rule:**
- A user cannot create a new document for a company if that company already has a document for the same date and place.
- For this first version, there is only one place: "UHS Palm Beach Garden Hospital".

### June 2024: Debugging & Resolution of Worker Details Display in Document Detail Page

**Issue:**
- Worker records were not displaying in the document detail page, despite correct queries and table permissions.

**Investigation Steps:**
- Verified table permissions for both `documents` and `documents_details` (both had correct SELECT privileges).
- Reviewed Row Level Security (RLS) policies for both tables.
- Confirmed that the RLS policy for `documents_details` was:
  ```sql
  USING (document_id IN (SELECT id FROM documents WHERE user_id = auth.uid()))
  ```
- Confirmed that the authenticated user in the app matched the `user_id` in the `documents` table.
- Ensured the app was using the correct Supabase session and not the anon key.
- Compared the working SQL query in Supabase dashboard with the app's query.

**Solution:**
- The issue was resolved by ensuring the app was authenticated as the correct user and that the RLS policy referenced the parent document's `user_id`.
- Once the user context matched, worker records displayed as expected in the app.
- The time format for worker records was also updated to display as `HH:MM` only, improving clarity in the UI.

**Lessons Learned:**
- RLS policies must reference the correct user context and parent relationships for detail tables.
- Always verify the authenticated user context in the app when debugging RLS issues.
- Matching the app's query to a working SQL query in the dashboard is a key troubleshooting step.
- UI formatting improvements (like time display) can be quickly implemented once data flow is correct.

**Status:**
- Worker details now display correctly in the document detail page.
- Time formatting is consistent and user-friendly.
- This milestone is complete.

### EmailJS API Size Limit Error & Solution (June 2024)

#### Issue
- When attempting to send documents via email, the app encounters an error:
  ```
  EmailJS API error: Variables size limit. The maximum allowed variables size is 50Kb
  ```
- This occurs because the document data being sent exceeds EmailJS's 50KB limit for template variables.

#### Solution
1. **Data Optimization**:
   - Implement data compression before sending to EmailJS
   - Remove unnecessary whitespace and formatting
   - Only include essential document data in the email template

2. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Add data compression utility:
     ```javascript
     const compressData = (data) => {
       return JSON.stringify(data)
         .replace(/\s+/g, '')  // Remove whitespace
         .replace(/"/g, "'");  // Use single quotes
     };
     ```

- Created a robust `DocumentParser` class to handle document processing:
  - Extracts and validates dates from all pages
  - Ensures all dates in the document match
  - Provides clear error messages for mismatches
  - Handles multi-page document processing
  - Validates worker records and time formats

#### Date Validation Features
1. **Multi-Page Date Validation**:
   - Extracts all dates from the entire document
   - Validates each date's format (MM/DD/YYYY)
   - Ensures all dates match across pages
   - Shows clear error messages for mismatches

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Shows which dates don't match
   - Indicates the primary date
   - Lists all mismatched dates
   - Provides guidance on how to fix the issue

3. **Code Organization**:
   - Class-based structure with private methods
   - Clear documentation
   - Singleton instance for easy use
   - Improved maintainability

#### Example Error Message
```
Multiple dates found in document that do not match:
Primary date: 01/15/2024
Mismatched dates: 01/16/2024, 01/17/2024
Please ensure all pages are from the same date.
```

#### Benefits
- Prevents processing of documents with mismatched dates
- Improves data accuracy
- Reduces manual correction needs
- Provides clear user feedback
- Maintains consistent date format across the app

#### Next Steps
1. Add date format conversion utilities
2. Implement date range validation
3. Add support for different date formats
4. Consider adding date validation rules per company
5. Enhance error messages with more specific guidance

### Document Processing Validation Logic Update (June 2024)

#### Changes Made
- Modified validation logic in `process.jsx` to handle time entries more flexibly:
  1. **Empty Entries Check**:
     - Now only validates end time if start time exists
     - Workers can have no times at all
     - Workers can have only an end time
     - Workers can have only a start time
     - If a worker has both times, end time must be after start time

2. **Validation Rules**:
   ```javascript
   // Rule 1: If start time exists, it must be valid
   if (w.timeIn && !isValidTimeHHmm(w.timeIn)) {
     return true;
   }

   // Rule 2: If end time exists, it must be valid
   if (w.timeOut && !isValidTimeHHmm(w.timeOut)) {
     return true;
   }

   // Rule 3: If both times exist, end time must be later than start time
   if (w.timeIn && w.timeOut) {
     const [inHours, inMinutes] = w.timeIn.split(':').map(Number);
     const [outHours, outMinutes] = w.timeOut.split(':').map(Number);
     const inTotalMinutes = inHours * 60 + inMinutes;
     const outTotalMinutes = outHours * 60 + outMinutes;
     if (outTotalMinutes <= inTotalMinutes) {
       return true;
     }
   }
   ```

#### Benefits
- More flexible validation that matches real-world scenarios
- Better handling of partial time entries
- Clearer validation messages
- Improved user experience for data entry

#### Next Steps
1. Consider adding validation for:
   - Maximum allowed time difference between start and end
   - Business hours restrictions
   - Break time handling
2. Add visual indicators for different validation states
3. Implement batch validation for multiple records
4. Add validation history tracking

### Worker List Sorting Implementation (June 2024)

#### Changes Made
- Implemented alphabetical sorting for worker records in the document processing screen:
  - Workers are now sorted by name when first processed from scanner data
  - Sorting is applied using `localeCompare()` for proper alphabetical ordering
  - Case sensitivity is handled correctly
  - International characters are supported

#### Implementation Details
```javascript
const workers = documentData.records
  .map((record, index) => ({
    id: index + 1,
    name: record.name,
    timeIn: record.timeIn || '',
    timeOut: record.timeOut || '',
    page: 1
  }))
  .sort((a, b) => a.name.localeCompare(b.name));
```

#### Benefits
- Improved data organization and readability
- Consistent worker order across the application
- Better user experience for finding specific workers
- Maintains sorting even after editing time entries

#### Next Steps
1. Consider adding:
   - Sort by time entries
   - Sort by status
   - Custom sort options
2. Add visual indicators for sort direction
3. Implement sort persistence across sessions
4. Add sort controls in the UI

### June 2024: Scanner/OCR Stability, Robust Parser, and Multi-Step Workflow Completion

- **Scanner & OCR Integration:**
  - The scanner now reliably allows users to pick or take images, converts them to base64, and sends them to the Google Vision API for OCR.
  - OCR results are stored in context and passed to the process screen, ensuring a seamless workflow.
  - Extensive logging and error handling have been added to confirm successful OCR and catch any issues early.

- **Process Screen & Robust Parser:**
  - The process screen uses a defensive, robust parser that includes iteration limits and comprehensive error handling to prevent infinite loops or UI freezes on malformed input.
  - Clear error messages are shown to users if the document format is unexpected (e.g., missing or mismatched dates, missing "NAMES" section).
  - The parser fully supports multi-page documents, removing all page footers and processing all worker records from every scanned sheet.

- **Multi-Step Document Workflow:**
  - The app's workflow (form → scan → process → export) is now stable and user-friendly.
  - State is managed in context across steps, preventing premature database writes and supporting a true multi-step experience.
  - The UI/UX is modern, branded, and consistent across all screens.

- **Documentation & Project Log:**
  - The `project_chat_log.md` remains the single source of truth for requirements, architecture, and all major decisions.
  - All significant changes, fixes, and refactors are logged for future reference and onboarding.

- **Next Steps:**
  - Continue refining the parser for additional edge cases and real-world document variations.
  - Enhance export and email features, including handling of large documents and user feedback.
  - Maintain and update documentation as the project evolves.
